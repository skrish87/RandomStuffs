# About the Project
The idea of this project is to understand the concepts of Angular like Binding, Scope, Events, Components, Observables, Services and interacting with Node.js backend within the same project. 

The frontend is designed using Bootstrap with responsive web design methods. This will work smoothly in all screen sizes.

Working with external APIs and how to integrate those with my Angular Application.

Understanding of different Node modules and working with tools like npm, nodemon, webpack etc.
